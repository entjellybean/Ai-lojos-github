# Lejos EV3 Robot challenge 

This project is part of our L3 complementary course called "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" .

## Goals 
The goal is to learn and implement AI algorithms in a Java program. 
The robot has to pick up pucks in the shortest amount of time, while competing with another robot.

###Sensors used
Ultrasonic Sensor
Touch Sensor
Color Sensor


### Overall Performance
The robot succesfully identifies the pucks, and when is needed avoids the obstacles.
There need more measures to be done to adjust the angle he uses to go and pick the pucks.

The methods are created in a way that allow for generalisation based on the environnement you're working.
